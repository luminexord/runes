# Introduction to Runes

Runes is a fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network that aims to be simple and UTXO-based. 
Rune balances are held by UTXOs, and transactions are identified using specific script conditions.
Luminex is launching a set of Rune tools, allowing anyone to effortlessly etch, mint and transfer Runes.

Runes are set to be officially released on Bitcoin mainnet at block 840,000, around the 20th April 2024.

Before then, you can test Luminex Runes tools on the Bitcoin testnet at: **LINK TO BE RELEASED**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is Rune?**  
RUNE is a UTXO-based fungible token protocol for the Bitcoin network. It allows for the issuance and management of tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

**2. Can RUNES be traded, transferred, or sold?**  
Many teams are working on integrating Runes within their platforms, like wallets, marketplaces, and more. We expect trading to commence once Runes are officially released on the mainnet.

**3. What's the difference between Open Mint, Premine and Closed Mint?**  

1. Open Mint: A rune that is available to mint from any address through an on-chain Rune transaction and allocate a fixed amount of new units for themselves. There is no mint price going to whoever deployed the Rune. An open mint is subject to the Mint Terms.

2. Premine: The deployer of the Rune can decide to allocate to themselves an amount of Runes within the Etching transaction. This allocation is called Premine.

2. Closed Mint: A rune can be fully pre-mined within the Etching transaction. The total supply will be equal to the premine allocation of the etcher.

**4. What are the Mint Terms?** 
 These are the rules that determine when an open mint opens or closes. For example, a mint may be limited to a starting height, an ending height, and a cap, and will be open between the starting height and ending height, or until the cap is reached, whichever comes first.

**5. What is a Runestone?** 
Runestones are the Rune protocol messages stored in the OP_RETURN output of the Rune transaction.

**6. What is a Cenotaph?** 
When a Runestone is malformed for whatever reason it is called a Cenotaph and in the event there is a Cenotaph all Runes in the transaction are burned

**7. What happens if I transfer a UTXO containing RUNE without the OP_RETURN R?**  
If you transfer a UTXO with Rune without the requisite OP_RETURN R, all Runes in that UTXO will be transferred to the first non OP_RETURN output. We recommend setting up a new address exclusively for receiving Ruens and refraining from transferring any UTXO from there until there's wallet integration.
